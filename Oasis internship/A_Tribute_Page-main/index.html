            <p>"Missle Man Of India'</p>
            <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th
                 president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace 
                 engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and 
                 Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in 
                 India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts[1] . He thus came to be known as the 
                 Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology[2][3][4] .
                  He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998,
                   the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.

                In 1990, the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award, was posthumously conferred on Ambedkar. The
                salutation Jai Bhim (lit. "Hail Bhim") used by followers honours him.</p>
